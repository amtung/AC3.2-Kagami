# Kagami
Kagami is a mirror with a heads up display with information from a set of customized widgets. Its budget-friendly and gives you, the user, absolute control of what is displayed. It requires minimal setup too, with a little DIY. 

We grabbed a monitor, powered it with a raspberry pi (a mini-sized computer) and then put it behind a 2-way mirror. Our iOS companion app then sends information that the user customizes to Firebase. Finally, a web server grabs that information and displays it beautifully onto our Kagami!

If you’re a tech enthusiast like us, always looking for gadgets to mess around with. Or have been looking to get a smart mirror simply because they’re awesome.  We have two blog posts that lays out what’s needed to build out the mirror, and instructions to set it up. 

We know you will have as much fun as we did building this!
